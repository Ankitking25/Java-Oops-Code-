//What is Exception
/*An exception condition is considered as a problem , which stops
 program execution form continuation from the point of occurence of it  */
//1.Division by zero(0)
//Array out of bound


//Why exception occurs
//User error
//Programmer Error


//What we can do
//1.Fix the problem and try again
//2.Do something else instead to avoid the problem
//3.Exit the application with Sytem.exit()
//4.Rethrow the exception to some other method or portion of code.
//5.Throw a new exception to replace it
//6.Return a default value(a non-void method-traditional way of handling exception).
//7.Eat the exception and return form the method (in a void method).In other words don't give importance to the exception
//8.Eat the execption and continue in the same method(Rare and dangerous.Be careful if you do this);
