 //One interface extended by more than one interface
/*1.IMPLEMENTING CLASS
 * 1.More than one interface can be implemented in a single class.
 * 2.If a class is implementing an interface using implements keyword
 * 3.If a class is implementing an interface it has to define all the method given in that interface
 * 4.If a class does not implement all the method declared in the interface, the class must be declared abstract.
 * 5.The method signature for the method in the class must match the method signature as it appears in the interface.
 * 6.Any class can use an interface's constansts from the  name of the interface like Test.roll.
 * 7.Classes that implement an interface can treat the constants as they were inherited.
