/*Abstract class and Abstract method*/
/*A  Class that is declared with abstract keyword , is known as abstract call in 
 java.It can have abstract and non-abstract methods .It needs to be extended and
 and its method implemented objects of an abstract class cannot be created   */
 //Syntax
//We cannot make an object of an abstract class
/* What is abstract method*//*------->A method that is declared as abstract and does
not have implementation is known as abstract method */
 

//Rules of Abstract class
/*1-->We cannot use abstract classes to instantiate objects directly
2-->Objects of an abstract class cannot be created
3-->The abstract method of an abstract class must be defined in its subclass.
4-->If there is any abstract method in a class , that class must be abstract.
5-->A class can be abstract without having abstract method.
6-->It is not necessary to declare all methods abstract in a abstract class
7-->We cannot declare all methods abstract in abstract class
8-->If you are extending any abstract class that have abstract method, you must
either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract. */
